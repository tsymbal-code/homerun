"""Proactive recorder subscription service.

Closes the coverage gap that drove the BacktestStudio fidelity bug:
the recorder was passive — it only captured markets the orchestrator
or a strategy had explicitly subscribed to.  Tail-end-carry-style
strategies that fire on low-volume EOL markets ended up with 38% of
their opportunity tokens having ZERO book data, and another 45%
where book capture started AFTER the strategy's first opportunity
on that token.

This service makes the recorder PROACTIVE.  It runs a periodic loop
on the trading plane that:

  1. Reads MarketCatalog (the canonical "all known active markets"
     view, refreshed every 5 min by market_runtime).
  2. Filters to markets that are: active, accepting orders, not
     closed/archived/resolved, with at least one clob_token_id.
  3. Ranks by liquidity (so when the cap bites, we keep the
     markets that actually trade).
  4. Subscribes the top ``MAX_RECORDED_TOKENS`` tokens via the
     existing single PolymarketWSFeed — same connection live
     trading uses; no separate WS pool, no auth duplication.

Existing 10-minute idle eviction in ``ws_feeds`` automatically prunes
truly-dead tokens from the subscription set so the cap stays
saturated with markets that actually move.

The cap exists because Polymarket CLOB tolerates a few thousand
subscriptions per connection but not infinite.  Default 8000 covers
the bulk of liquid markets (~80% of $100+ liquidity tier).  Operators
can raise it via the ``HOMERUN_RECORDER_MAX_TOKENS`` env var or by
patching the constant if they're willing to take the WS-bandwidth
hit for full fidelity.

"""Crypto strategy firehose — terminal-visible per-gate evaluation events.

The trader Terminal tab only renders events emitted via
``buffer_trader_event``.  Crypto strategies historically silently
``return None`` at each rejection point; this helper makes those
decisions visible to the user, tagged with a verbosity tier so the
volume can be tuned in the UI.

Tiers (lowest → loudest, matched to the UI volume dial):

* ``WHISPER`` — every market evaluated every cycle, even ones that
  fail the cheapest gates (timeframe match, asset list, milestone
  not yet crossed).  Hundreds of events per minute under load.
* ``MURMUR``  — only markets that passed the cheap gates and died
  on a meaningful one (oracle freshness, distance, VWAP, book depth).
* ``VOICE``   — an Opportunity was emitted; passed every gate.
* ``SHOUT``   — orders / executions (used by the execution layer,
  not strategies).
* ``ALARM``   — errors / exceptions; emitted as ``severity="error"``
  and always shown regardless of the user's volume setting.

Firehose events use ``event_type="firehose_gate"`` (single-gate
rejections), ``event_type="firehose_evaluation"`` (full gate-by-gate
summary), and ``event_type="firehose_emit"`` (opportunity emitted).
All carry ``source="crypto"`` so the UI can route them to the Crypto
bot's Terminal tab.

Trader-id is intentionally ``None`` — these events describe global
strategy state, not a specific trader's decision flow.  The UI
matches them to a trader by ``source_key`` + the trader's enabled
strategies.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Strategy-emit eligibility cache
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Pre-fix, every strategy that ran on_event for a tick fired firehose
# evaluation events to the trader-events stream.  That meant:
#   * Strategies loaded but bound to no active trader (e.g. spike_
#     reversion when no trader has it in source_configs) still spammed
#     the Live Pulse feed with rejections.
#   * Events fired even when the orchestrator was disabled.
#   * Per-bot terminals leaked events from strategies the bot doesn't
#     run (because the events carried no trader_id).
#
# This cache resolves all three:
#   * ``_orchestrator_enabled`` → if False, suppress emit entirely.
#   * ``_strategy_to_trader_ids`` → the set of trader_ids (live AND
#     shadow, per Plan 0044) that have ``strategy_slug`` in their
#     ``source_configs``.  If empty, suppress emit (no one consumes
#     this strategy's signals).  Otherwise, tag the event payload
#     with the list so per-bot terminals can filter by
#     ``trader_id IN bound_trader_ids``.
#
#   Plan 0044: pre-fix this cache filtered to ``mode='live'`` only,
#   which silenced firehose telemetry for shadow traders — leaving
#   shadow operators with zero visibility into why their strategy
#   wasn't emitting opportunities. We now include shadow bindings
#   so the Terminal tab fires for both tiers. Live behaviour for the
#   live-only case is unchanged because the live trader stays in the
#   binding map.
#
# TTL is short (3 s) — orchestrator enable / trader-config edits show
# up to firehose within a single refresh.

# and kick off a background refresh — that prevents a thundering herd
# of evaluation tasks from queueing behind one DB roundtrip when the
# DB momentarily slows down.  Above the hard ceiling we resume blocking

# events per market they consider — easily 300-600 fire-and-forget
# tasks per second.  When the binding cache refresh blocked on a slow
# DB query (or audit-write Redis publish hiccupped), tasks accumulated
# faster than they drained, saturating the event loop and pushing
# orchestrator cycles to 30-90 s.

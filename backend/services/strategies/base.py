    Full Signal Lifecycle
    =====================

    Every opportunity flows through this pipeline. Understanding it is
    essential for strategy authors — each gate can alter or block your signal.

    1. **Detection** — ``detect()`` / ``detect_async()`` / ``on_event()``
       Your strategy examines market data and returns ``list[Opportunity]``.
       Called by the scanner (MARKET_DATA_REFRESH) or workers (CRYPTO_UPDATE,
       WEATHER_UPDATE, TRADER_ACTIVITY, NEWS_UPDATE, DATA_SOURCE_UPDATE, etc.).

    2. **Quality Filter** — ``QualityFilterPipeline.evaluate_opportunity()``
       10 structural checks (min ROI, directional cap, plausible ROI, max legs,
       per-leg liquidity, hard liquidity floor, min position size, min absolute
       profit, resolution timeframe, annualized ROI). Override thresholds via
       ``quality_filter_overrides`` class attribute. Rejected opportunities are
       still written to the DB with ``quality_passed=False``.

    3. **Cross-Strategy Deduplication** — same market + similar ROI from
       multiple strategies collapses to the best signal. Opt out via
       ``allow_deduplication = False``.

    4. **Runtime Intent Publication** — ``strategy_signal_bridge.bridge_opportunities_to_signals()``
       Opportunity is published into the in-process intent runtime immediately.
       ``trade_signals`` is a projected audit table, not the transport.

    5. **Signal Expiry** — stale signals past ``expires_at`` are skipped.

    6. **Orchestrator Pickup** — ``trader_orchestrator_worker`` consumes the
       runtime queue and calls ``strategy.evaluate(signal, context)``.

    7. **Evaluate** — ``evaluate(signal, context) -> StrategyDecision``
       Your strategy decides whether to trade the signal RIGHT NOW.
       If ``scoring_weights`` is set, uses the composable pipeline
       (``custom_checks`` + ``compute_score`` + ``compute_size``).
       Returns ``StrategyDecision`` with decision = selected|skipped|blocked.

    8. **Risk Manager Gates** (applied by orchestrator, not strategy):
       - Daily loss limit (``BlockReason.RISK_DAILY_LOSS``)
       - Gross exposure cap (``BlockReason.RISK_GROSS_EXPOSURE``)
       - Consecutive loss guard (``BlockReason.RISK_CONSECUTIVE_LOSS``)
       - Trade notional cap (``BlockReason.RISK_TRADE_NOTIONAL``)
       - Open positions limit (``BlockReason.RISK_OPEN_POSITIONS``)
       - Per-market exposure cap (``BlockReason.RISK_MARKET_EXPOSURE``)
       Your ``on_blocked(signal, reason, context)`` fires if blocked.

    9. **Trading Window** — UTC time-of-day gate. ``BlockReason.TRADING_WINDOW``.

    10. **Stacking Guard** — prevents opening a second position on the same
        market. ``BlockReason.STACKING_GUARD``.

    11. **Size Capping** — position size clamped to ``max_trade_notional_usd``.
        Your ``on_size_capped(original, capped, reason)`` fires if capped.

    12. **Order Execution** — the order manager places the trade.

    13. **Position Lifecycle** — ``should_exit(position, market_state)``
        called every cycle for open positions. Default applies TP/SL/trailing/
        max-hold from config.

    Strategy Types
    ==============

    Implement **at least one** of:

    * ``detect()`` — synchronous detection (run in thread-pool executor).
    * ``detect_async()`` — async detection (preferred for I/O-bound work such
      as LLM calls, HTTP requests, or database queries). Awaited on the event loop.
    * Override ``on_event()`` — only needed when your strategy reacts to
      non-standard event types (crypto, weather, news) with custom payload logic.

    Scanner strategies subscribe to ``EventType.MARKET_DATA_REFRESH`` and only
    need to implement ``detect()`` — the default ``on_event()`` handles routing.

    BlockReason Reference
    =====================

    All ``BlockReason`` codes that can be passed to ``on_blocked()``:

    - ``QUALITY_FILTER`` — failed QualityFilterPipeline (ROI, liquidity, etc.)
    - ``RISK_DAILY_LOSS`` — daily realized loss exceeds configured limit
    - ``RISK_GROSS_EXPOSURE`` — total open notional exceeds exposure cap
    - ``RISK_CONSECUTIVE_LOSS`` — too many consecutive losing trades
    - ``RISK_TRADE_NOTIONAL`` — single trade notional exceeds per-trade cap
    - ``RISK_OPEN_POSITIONS`` — max open positions reached
    - ``RISK_MARKET_EXPOSURE`` — per-market exposure cap reached
    - ``TRADING_WINDOW`` — outside configured UTC trading hours
    - ``STACKING_GUARD`` — already have a position on this market
    - ``SIGNAL_EXPIRED`` — signal past its expires_at timestamp
    - ``SCANNER_POOL_CAPACITY`` — scanner opportunity pool is full
    - ``DEDUPLICATION`` — duplicate signal collapsed with a better one

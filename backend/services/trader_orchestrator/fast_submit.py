"""Single-leg direct submission path for fast-tier traders.

``execute_fast_signal`` is the narrow fast-path alternative to the full
``ExecutionSessionEngine.execute_signal`` orchestration.  It is designed
for ``latency_class='fast'`` traders that trade one leg on one market at
a time (sub-second crypto binaries are the canonical use case).

Key differences vs. SessionEngine:

* No ``execution_sessions`` / ``execution_session_orders`` /
  ``execution_session_legs`` / ``execution_session_events`` rows.
* No pre-submit placeholder with a 45s ack timeout.
* No leg-wave / reprice orchestration — one attempt, one result.
* A single short DB transaction writes one ``TraderOrder`` row and its
  verification event; inventory rebuilds are left to the slower workers.

The low-level submission to the provider still flows through the
well-tested ``submit_execution_leg`` primitive in ``order_manager``, so
every token-resolution, buy pre-submit gate, shadow-mode microstructure-fill and
live-provider submission path remains identical to the orchestrated one.

A fast trader *must* be single-leg single-market.  If the signal has no
``positions_to_take`` or multiple positions, we refuse and return a
``blocked`` result — the trader config is the bug, not the runtime.

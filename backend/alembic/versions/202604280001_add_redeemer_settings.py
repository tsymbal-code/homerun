"""add redeemer policy columns to app_settings

Revision ID: 202604280001
Revises: 202604270001
Create Date: 2026-04-28

The CTF redeemer worker needs operator-tunable policy:

  * ``redeemer_min_payout_usd`` — skip redemption when expected payout
    is below this floor. This is the world-class guard against burning
    gas to redeem $0-payout positions (lost binary outcomes).
  * ``redeemer_max_gas_price_gwei`` — skip redemption when network gas
    is elevated above this ceiling. Defers cleanup to a cheaper window.
  * ``redeemer_force_including_losers`` — operator-only override that
    redeems every resolved condition regardless of payout, useful for
    one-off wallet hygiene sweeps. Costs gas with no return for losing
    outcomes; only flip when intentionally cleaning up dust.

The columns are nullable so existing rows fall through to code defaults
in ``config.Settings`` and ``apply_settings_overrides`` without a
backfill. Defaults are tuned for Polygon: ~120k gas × ~30 gwei × MATIC
≈ $0.001 per redemption tx, so a $0.10 floor leaves a comfortable 100×
safety margin.

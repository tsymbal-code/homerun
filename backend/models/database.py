    Holds the full run lifecycle: from initial enqueue (operator clicks

    The split from "run" to "run + job" is deliberate — having a single
    canonical row eliminates the need for a separate jobs table and a
    join to read run state.

    Lifecycle (``status`` column):

      queued    → enqueued, waiting for a worker to claim it
      running   → claimed by a worker; ``progress`` 0.0→1.0,
                  ``message`` carries human-readable activity

    The dedicated backtest worker process (workers/backtest_worker.py)
    polls this table for ``status='queued'`` rows and runs them off
    the API event loop entirely — guarantees the orchestrator and
    other workers cannot be impacted by a long-running backtest.

    ``payload_json`` carries the full run request shape:
        { source_code, slug, config, token_ids, start, end,
          initial_capital_usd, ... } so the worker can reconstruct
        the run without reading other tables.

# ── Realized P&L: computed-baseline-with-verifier-override ────────
#
# ``actual_profit`` carries the BEST AVAILABLE realized P&L estimate
# at any moment.  It is populated by two layers:
#
#   1. The lifecycle / reconcile path computes ``actual_profit`` from
#      the bot's recorded fill (size, price) and the close event
#      (close_price for resolutions, sell-fill price for early exits).
#      This is the BASELINE — the UI sees real numbers immediately
#      after the close event lands, instead of $0.
#
#   2. ``polymarket_trade_verifier`` runs periodically and OVERWRITES
#      ``actual_profit`` with on-chain truth (matched against
#      transactionHash from polymarket.get_wallet_trades, or against
#      the deterministic resolution payout).  When the verifier
#      writes, it also bumps ``verification_status`` to
#      ``wallet_activity`` so the UI can flag the row as verified.
#
# The previous architecture (silent-NULL guard, removed in Fix KK)
# rejected layer 1 writes entirely — only the verifier could write
# ``actual_profit``.  This was meant to make phantom-PnL impossible,
# but in practice it produced a far worse failure mode: when the
# verifier's HTTP fetch timed out (12s budget on closed_positions),
# resolved positions sat at ``actual_profit = NULL`` for hours, and
# the UI rendered "$0 R-P&L" — operators reasonably interpreted this
# as a 100% loss when the position had actually won.  Cure was worse
# than the disease.
#
# Trade-off accepted: a buggy lifecycle computation could write a
# wrong baseline (the Athletics/Rangers case from the old guard's
# motivation: phantom +$49 when actual was -$9).  Mitigations:
#   * ``verification_status`` distinguishes baseline vs verified, so
#     dashboards can flag unverified rows.
#   * The verifier's overwrite is the durable correctness anchor —
#     even if a lifecycle write is wrong, the next verifier sweep
#     replaces it with on-chain truth.
#   * Lifecycle paths use the bot's own recorded fill data, not
#     wallet aggregates, so the conflation problem that produced the
#     old phantom case is structurally ruled out at the source.
#
# Operators relying on ``SUM(actual_profit)`` for ledger-grade P&L
# should join through ``trader_order_verification`` and filter to
# ``verification_status IN ('wallet_activity', 'manual_writeoff')``
# for verified-only aggregates.  The default (all rows) is the live
# operational P&L view.


# ── trader_order_verification: writer-isolation table ────────────────
#
# Splits the verification-related columns off TraderOrder onto a
# 1-to-1 child table.  Rationale: the Polymarket verifier and the
# orchestrator/lifecycle BOTH UPDATE the same trader_orders row.  Even
# though the verifier only touches verification_* + actual_profit and
# the orchestrator only touches status + payload_json, PG row-locks
# are at the row level, so the two writers serialize on the same
# TransactionID lock.  The 24h log captured this as
# ``LOCK CONTENTION ... UPDATE trader_orders SET status=...
# verification_status=...``.
#
# Splitting verification fields onto their own row eliminates the lock
# collision STRUCTURALLY: verifier writes to trader_order_verification,
# orchestrator writes to trader_orders, no shared row, no lock queue.
#
# Migration is staged across multiple commits:
#   * THIS commit (step 1): add table + ORM model + backfill.  No
#     application code reads or writes from the new table yet.  Schema
#     is purely additive; rolling back is just an index drop.
#   * Step 2: route verifier writes to the new table.  Orchestrator
#     keeps writing trader_orders.verification_status for the
#     wallet_position path.  Readers fall back: prefer the new table's
#     value, drop to the old column when missing.
#   * Step 3: drop old columns once readers are fully cut over.

class TraderOrderVerification(Base):

    Why a separate table: the verifier and the orchestrator both write

    columns.  Moving verification fields to their own row makes the

# guarantees the side table is always in sync with the canonical
# columns on trader_orders WITHOUT requiring every existing caller
# (40+ direct write sites + apply_trader_order_verification +
# polymarket_trade_verifier) to be updated.
#
# Step 3 (this commit): readers prefer the side table via
# COALESCE(v.*, t.*) so once dual-write is in place the new table is
# already authoritative for new verifications.
#
# Step 4 (FUTURE commit, after validation): once readers are fully
# cut over and we've confirmed P&L numbers match in production, drop
# the verification_status / verification_source / verification_reason
# / verification_tx_hash / verified_at / actual_profit columns from
# trader_orders.  At that point the verifier and orchestrator never
# share a row-lock target.
#
# Trade-off during dual-write window: every TraderOrder UPSERT does
# an extra UPSERT on trader_order_verification in the same connection
# / same transaction.  Both UPSERTs are sub-millisecond against indexes
# on PK / trader_order_id, so the additional row-lock surface is tiny.

# ==================== FAST-TIER ENGINE ====================
#
# Dedicated engine + session factory for the fast latency tier.  Traders with
# ``latency_class='fast'`` run through this pool exclusively; it is isolated
# from the main pool so a slow reconciliation query (30s statement_timeout on
# the main engine) cannot starve a sub-second crypto bot of connections.
#
# Deliberately small: a fast trader does one short write per trade, on an
# event-triggered cycle, so a handful of dedicated connections is plenty.  No
# overflow — we WANT ``pool_timeout`` errors surfaced fast if the pool saturates
# rather than queueing behind slow work.
#
# Statement timeout is aggressive (2500ms): any DB query the fast path makes
# that runs longer than that is pathological and should fail loud instead of
# holding a connection. Lock timeout is shorter (500ms) so a row contended
# by the scanner / orchestrator surfaces as a clean LockNotAvailable error
# (which the retry path handles cleanly) instead of letting the wait expand
# the query into the statement-timeout window — that path is the one that
# corrupts the asyncpg protocol state and produces the recurring
# "cannot switch to state X; another operation (Y) is in progress" warnings.
